<p>Enclosed in this envelope is the cord and the
needle with which to bind this book. Start in from
the outside as shown on the diagram here. Pass the
needle and thread through the center of the book,
leaving an end extend outside, then through to the
outside, about 2 inches from the center; then from
the outside to inside 2 inches from the center at the
other end of the book, bringing the thread finally
again through the center, and tie the two ends in a
knot, one each side of the cord on the outside.</p>

<p class="h2">HOW TO USE THIS BOOK</p>

<hr />

<p class="noindent">This book is one of a series known as the CHILD'S OWN
BOOK OF GREAT MUSICIANS, written by Thomas
Tapper, author of "Pictures from the Lives of the Great Composers
for Children," "Music Talks with Children," "First
Studies in Music Biography," and others.</p>

<p>The sheet of illustrations included herewith is to be cut
apart by the child, and each illustration is to be inserted in its
proper place throughout the book, pasted in the space containing
the same number as will be found under each picture on the
sheet. It is not necessary to cover the entire back of a picture
with paste. Put it only on the corners and place neatly within
the lines you will find printed around each space. Use photographic
paste, if possible.</p>

<p>After this play-work is completed there will be found at
the back of the book blank pages upon which the child is to
write his own story of the great musician, based upon the facts
and questions found on the previous pages.</p>

<p>The book is then to be sewed by the child through the
center with the cord found in the enclosed envelope. The book
thus becomes the child's own book.</p>

<p>This series will be found not only to furnish a pleasing and
interesting task for the children, but will teach them the main
facts with regard to the life of each of the great musicians&mdash;an
educational feature worth while.</p>

<hr />

<p class="h2">The Story of a Boy Who Became a Great<br />
Pianist and Teacher</p>

<p>This is the house in which was born a little boy
who became a famous pianist and a great teacher.
This house is in Raiding, in Hungary.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus02.png" alt="No. 2" title="No. 2" /><br />
<span class="caption">HOUSE IN WHICH FRANZ LISZT WAS BORN</span>
</div>

<p>Now-a-days there is a little tablet over the door,
which tells us that Franz Liszt was born in this house,
on the Twenty-second Day of
October, 1811.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus03.png" alt="No. 3" title="No. 3" /><br />
<span class="caption">JOSEPH HAYDN</span>
</div>

<p>Do you remember that once
upon a time Joseph Haydn lived
as court musician in the Esterhazy
family? He wore a tie wig
and a wonderful bright uniform;
for he was master of the music
in that great house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;4]</span></p>

<p>Now, long after Joseph Haydn's time, Adam
Liszt, father of Franz, lived with the Esterhazy's.
He was the family steward, having charge of all the
property.</p>

<p>And, too, he loved music. So we may believe
that he told his little boy, Franz, about the great
master Haydn. For Adam Liszt was not only a
lover of music but he gave his son his first lessons in
piano playing. Liszt's mother was of German blood.
She was born in lower Austria.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/illus05.png" alt="No. 5" title="No. 5" /><br />
<span class="caption">LISZT&#39;S MOTHER AND FATHER</span>
</div>

<p>Little Franz practiced so faithfully and so eagerly,
I am sure, that when he was only nine years of age
he gave a concert in public. He played so well that
some good friends offered to send him to Vienna
where he could continue his studies.</p>

<p>And so the little boy left home and began the
studies that led him to become the greatest pianist
of his time. His piano teacher was a man of whom almost
everybody knows. Does he not have a round,
good-natured face? And does he not look kind? Well,
he could be severe when his pupil's lessons did not
please him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;5]</span></p>

<p>His name was Carl Czerny. Here is his picture.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus06.png" alt="No. 6" title="No. 6" /><br />
<span class="caption">CARL CZERNY</span>
</div>

<p>On New Year's day of the year that little Franz
was eleven years old he played in public in Vienna.
It must have been a wonderful occasion. All the great
people were there; and among them was one who was
greatest of all, Beethoven.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus07.png" alt="No. 7" title="No. 7" /><br />
<span class="caption">BEETHOVEN</span>
</div>

<p>Then Adam Liszt thought his boy should go to
Paris. He wished him to become a student in the conservatory
there. But its director, Cherubini, refused
to admit Franz to the classes. So, like most of us,
he studied with a private teacher. Also, he traveled
to England and to all the countries of Europe, giving
concerts. His fame was becoming greater and his
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;6]</span>
playing was the delight of all who heard him. Here
are two pictures of Franz as a boy. He dressed differently
from boys of to-day. But do you not think
his face is a fine one? Full of light and life and eagerness?</p>

<span class="caption">LISZT AS A BOY</span>
</div>

<p>Franz was only sixteen years old when his father
died. They had been good comrades, had traveled
together and talked with one another about music
and musicians. The boy must have grieved keenly
over the loss of so good and kind a companion as his
father had been. But he went earnestly to work to
earn a living for his mother and himself. He knew
many famous people and we may be sure that everyone
helped him. Here are two of Franz's friends of
that time.</p>

<span class="caption">AT THE PIANO</span>
</div>

<p>I am sure you will like
to know how Liszt looked
as he sat at the piano. Here
he sits playing. You see he
had only a simple kind of
piano. But he mastered it
so thoroughly that he could
make people wonder at his
art. That is what we learn
from the lives of famous
people. They are always
true to their talent.</p>

<p>After Liszt had traveled
many years over Europe
(he never visited the United States), he became conductor
at the Court Theatre at Weimar. This new
music work interested him so much that he gave up
travel as a concert pianist. He helped many composers
by having their operas performed at the
Weimar Theatre. Some of the operas that had
their first performance there are now famous
indeed.</p>

<p>Among these were "Lohengrin," "Tannhauser"
and "The Flying Dutchman" by Richard Wagner.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus13.png" alt="No. 13" title="No. 13" />
<img src="images/illus14.png" alt="No. 14" title="No. 14" />
<img src="images/illus15.png" alt="No. 15" title="No. 15" /><br />
<span class="caption">R. WAGNER  -  R. SCHUMANN  -  F. SCHUBERT</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;8]</span></p>

<p>Then there were "Genoveva" and "Manfred" by
Robert Schumann. Also "Alfonzo and Estrella" by
Franz Schubert was given. It would have delighted
Schubert's heart if he could have heard this; but he,
poor man, had died some years before.</p>

<p>Then Liszt did something else at Weimar that endeared
him to hosts of pianists. He held classes and
taught the secrets of his wonderful playing to those
who were talented and could understand. He was
the soul of generosity. When someone, who was
gifted but could not pay, came for advice, he gave it
freely. When concerts did not pay, he himself often
took the loss so that others should not suffer.</p>

<p>Is it not wonderful to think of a man, so loved by
the public, giving with such great generosity? Truly
it is better to give than to receive.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;9]</span>
All good and wonderful things live on forever.
Even though Liszt moved from Weimar, spending
his last years in Budapest, Rome and elsewhere, he
was not idle. There was always a circle of people
about him. And always his full-hearted, generous
nature kept him at work for the good of others. He
reminds us of Beethoven who once said, "Composing
is a capital thing. For instance if a friend is in distress
and I have no money at hand to help him, I can sit
down and compose something which I can sell and
so relieve him." It seems that Franz Liszt thought the
same for he was forever helping someone else.</p>

<p>We have already seen how Liszt looked as he sat
at the piano (see picture No. 12). This is Liszt at the
conductor's stand. Do you see his baton and the score
on the desk? And the position of the left hand?
When Liszt conducted the orchestra the players
watched every movement of his hands and every look
of his eyes so as to play just as he desired.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus17.png" alt="No. 17" title="No. 17" /><br />
<span class="caption">LISZT AS CONDUCTOR</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;10]</span>Franz Liszt was kind to all people
who came to him. There was
one musician, however, for whom
he did a great deal. You know
him for he composed many operas.
One of them is called "Parsifal."
Another is "The Flying Dutchman."
Place his picture here and
write his name beneath.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus18.png" alt="No. 18" title="No. 18" />
</div>

<p>Some day the operas of Richard
Wagner will give you great pleasure.
At first they were not liked by the public. Wagner
had few friends and his life was very hard. But
Franz Liszt believed in him and in his work. And so
he helped him.</p>

<p>At first Wagner did not like Liszt. He once said,
"I never repeated my first call on Liszt." By this he
meant that he wished the acquaintance to end. When
Liszt realized that Wagner did not care to understand
him, he tried his best to keep the friendship secure.
Liszt never wished to misunderstand another human
being. So, it was not long before Wagner's opinion of
Liszt changed, for he said, later, "Through the love
of this rarest friend I gained a real home for my art."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus19.png" alt="No. 19" title="No. 19" /><br />
<span class="caption">LISZT&#39;S HAND</span>
</div>

<p>There is one thing true for us all. We carry our
early thoughts along with us all through life. The
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;11]</span>
friends we make from youth and the thoughts we
think from youth are always at hand to bless us if we
have done wisely.</p>

<p>Once when little Franz was thirteen years old he
played before the English King, George IV. Sixty
years later we see him again, once more the guest of
the English people.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to think of Liszt meeting again and
again the friends of his boyhood. When he went to
England, on this occasion, he was quite an old man. As
he stepped out upon the stage to play, for the last time,
everybody, even the people outside of the hall, who
could not get in, shouted themselves hoarse. Those
within rose to greet him with tears and cheers that
are given only to the kings of the earth.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus20.png" alt="No. 20" title="No. 20" /><br />
<span class="caption">LISZT IN LATER LIFE</span>
</div>

<p>While we know of this artist chiefly as a great
pianist, we shall learn, as we grow older, that he was
a great composer as well. He wrote music for piano,
for orchestra, for the voice. There are symphonies,
masses, oratorios and cantatas. Once, as a boy, he
met Franz Schubert in Vienna. In later years he arranged
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;12]</span>
many of Schubert's songs in a truly beautiful
way for the piano,&mdash;songs like the "Erl King," "Thou
Art My Peace," "Hark, Hark the Lark."</p>

<p>So we may end by saying that Franz Liszt was a
great man who remained simple and big-hearted all
his life, and one whom the world loved for what he
did.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
